Query Optimization and EXPLAIN Statement Discussion\

Optimization is a key aspect of queries and scripts as its usually not possible to the resourcces needed to make a script run as quickly as possible.
It is also important to ensure overoptimzation does not occur as this can be unneccessary and result in excessive usage of resources. The EXPLAIN statement
is a powerful tool available for developers and coders that can be used to optimize SQL statements and scripts. 

When a query is executed, the MySQL Query Optimizer tries to devise an optimal plan for query execution. This plan and the information associated 
with it can be viewed plan by prefixing the query with EXPLAIN. With the help of EXPLAIN, you can see where you should add indexes to tables so 
that the statement executes faster by using indexes to find rows. The EXPLAIN statement can also be used to check whether the optimizer joins the tables in an optimal order.
